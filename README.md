Simple program to help me do some checkups on my Fortigate's.

1 - Connects on Fortigate
2 - Reads a file with the commands named "comandos.txt
3 - Send the commands to Fortigate
4 - Take the output and write in an file call "saida.txt"

** Remember you need to install "libssh-dev" for Debian/Ubuntu and "libssh-devel" for Redhat/Fedora
** When compile use -lssh. This informe to the compiler to use the libssh library.
